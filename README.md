# Abalone

A speech recognition based IBUS input method for GNU/Linux desktops, based on Mozilla's DeepSpeech model.

Abalone consists of two components, the Abalone IBUS plugin, which can be used for speech input across all applications on GNU/Linux desktop, and the Abalone Trainer, which makes it possible to fine tune the speech recognition model based on an individual user's voice to improve accuracy.
